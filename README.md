# What is this and how do i use it
NoBlock is a simple shell script that unblocks access to blocked websites, blocked either by parental controls or by your ISP. <br>
To use NoBlock, simple clone the repo or download the script (NoBlock.bat) then double click it (it will automatically request admin rights if not given).
